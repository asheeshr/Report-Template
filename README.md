### Introduction

This is a Latex Template for major/minor/interim project reports that are required to be submitted as part of coursework.
This template is easy to use. It can be used with anyone having very basic knowledge of LaTeX. Instructions are provided inline in the files to help along the way.

### Directory Structure

The directory structure consists of two folders:
- Write-Up : This folder contains the `.tex` files in which you will need to add your content. Other auxiliary files will be generated as you work on the report.
- Figures : This folder is for adding all the figures, images, drawings, that you may need to add. Use `.png` files if possible. Some other extensions will also work.

This structure helps keeping the overall report easy to maintain and extend.

### Report Structure

The report is divided into multiple `.tex` files to make it easy to work with. The default structure is:
- title.tex
- certificate.tex
- acknowledgements.tex
- abstract.tex
- intro.tex
- litsurvey.tex
- design.tex
- results.tex
- conclusion.tex
- bibliography.tex


### Compiling

Open [mainfile.tex](https://github.com/AsheeshR/Report-Template/blob/master/Write-Up/mainfile.tex) in any TeX editor and compile.
It should compile with no errors. There may be some `badbox` warnings; you may read more about that [here](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/50830/31203).
